MDropDX12 is:
- **MDropDX12 Visualizer**:
    A ground-up DirectX 12 rebuild of the [MilkDrop2](https://www.geisswerks.com/milkdrop/) visualizer engine, with GPU-accelerated text rendering, an in-app settings UI, and broad preset compatibility improvements
- **MDropDX12 Remote**:
    A standalone window to do things like sending messages (either directly by typing or from a script file), load and change presets, send common key combinations using buttons and more

## History

The original [MilkDrop2](https://www.geisswerks.com/milkdrop/) WinAmp plugin created by Ryan Geiss was turned into a Windows standalone application by Maxim Volskiy as [BeatDrop](https://github.com/mvsoft74/BeatDrop) and has since been improved upon eg. in the [BeatDrop-Music-Visualizer](https://github.com/OfficialIncubo/BeatDrop-Music-Visualizer) project. MDropDX12 originally started as a fork of BeatDrop-Music-Visualizer.

This version of the Visualizer is a ground-up rebuild of the rendering engine on DirectX 12, replacing the original DX9Ex backend entirely. The text rendering pipeline, settings UI, texture management, shader compilation, and resource handling have all been rewritten. While preset compatibility with the MilkDrop2 ecosystem is maintained, the codebase has diverged significantly from the upstream MDropDX12 project.

For a more detailed explanation of all features, please read the [Manual](https://github.com/shanevbg/MDropDX12/blob/main/Manual.md). 

For a chronological list of MDropDX12 releases and features, read the [Changes](Changes.md).

## System Requirements

* Windows 11 64-bit or higher
* DirectX 12 compatible GPU
* [Microsoft .NET Desktop Runtime 8](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0) (for Remote)

## Support

This project incorporates the work of many different authors over the years, as listed below. Naturally, the entirety of this project is Open Source and there will never be a paid version of it.

However, if you're satisfied with the additions I made and you want to support my work, you may do so using [**Ko-fi**](https://ko-fi.com/ikeserver) or [**PayPal**](https://www.paypal.com/ncp/payment/5XMP3S69PJLCU). You'll be listed as a supporter within the next program release unless you don't want to.

Many thanks to **Shanev**, **Tures1955** and **hatecubed** for supporting the development of MDropDX12. ❤️

I may add new features or fix bugs if people are actually using this, so don't be shy to [open an issue](https://github.com/shanevbg/MDropDX12/issues) or join my [**Discord**](https://bit.ly/Ikes-Discord)!

Although the original Matthew van Eerde's [loopback-capture](https://github.com/mvaneerde/blog) project didn't explicitly state the license, the author has been kind enough to provide a license clarification [here](

## Public use of MilkDrop Presets

The presets themselves are not covered by either of these licenses, they either have their own license or none (in most cases). None of the presets in MDropDX12 should have a restrictive license preventing you from using them in public. All preset filenames from shaders I converted have the original author's name in them, with the full original source mentioned in the preset file itself.

So, my pragmatic and common sense approach would be: Always keep in mind that you are using the artistic work of someone else. Respect the original authors work by showing the preset filename (at least briefly), and you should be fine. If in doubt, always ask the creator of the piece you use.
